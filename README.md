## About the Project
This project either prompts the user to enter in a specified number of integers, or it randomly generates integers.  Then, those integers are appended to a list.  With the creation of the list, some simple statistics are done and some information about the list is displayed to the user.

The objective of this program is to demonstrate the following: 
* demonstrate understanding of writing function definitions and calling functions within main
* amalgamate the current acquired knowledge of Python, such as input/output, if/elif/else statements, loops, random number generation, lists and functions into one program
* further practice the basics of Python arithmetic

This program assumes that the user will enter a valid input each time the program requests an integer value.  The program's output will result in unknown behavior if anything other than an integer is entered by the user.  

## Getting Started
To run the program, download the contents of the project and simply run make in the terminal.
